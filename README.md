1. What has been done?
-> frontend Web application to create a mutual fund portfolio.
-> mutualfund data is fetched from given api 
-> rendered the huge data using "react-virtualized List" 
-> Search and filter is implemented...users can search mutual funds
-> onSearch users can select mutualfunds and can add it to the portfolio list
-> an alert message is shown on successfully adding the mutual fund in portfolio list
-> In portfolio list, on clicking details button popUp is displayed
-> The pop up shows the following scheme details-
● scheme name
● fund house
● Scheme category
● Scheme type
● Latest nav
-> Users can increase or decrease the number of units of a mutual fund, onClicking Buy/Sell
-> The portfolio page lists all mutual funds selected and total units currently available in the
portfolio.
-> popUp can be closed onClicking "X"
-> web app is made as SPA(single page application) by using react-router-dom


2. What more you would have done if you had more time, If there is anything.

-> UI styling can be made better
-> Debouncing could have been added in search
-> react-virtualized List, auto-sizer could have been used
-> could have added responsiveness to the web app

3. Known bugs and limitations
-> onClicking Sell, the available units value is decreasing but when it is 1, the mutualfund is not getting removed properly

TechStack used & the Dependencies:
* react: v18.2.0
* react-router-dom: v6.10.0
* react-virtualized: v9.22.3





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
